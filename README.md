# Closest-Pair-and-Karatsuba-DAA
Karatsuba Multiplication: Efficiently multiplies large integers with reduced time complexity (O(n^1.58)).  

Closest Pair of Points: Finds the closest pair among a set of 2D points in O(n log n) time.

Karatsuba.ipynb	Notebook implementing Karatsuba multiplication with example test cases.

ClosestPair.ipynb	Notebook implementing the closest pair of points using divide and conquer.

DAAProjectcodes.ipynb	Consolidated notebook containing both algorithms with test cases and visualizations.
